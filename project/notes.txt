Raspberry Pi camera
Power supply for the Raspberry Pi and servo or solenoid. For powering a micro servo, a 4x AA battery pack is a simple option.
4 Push button
10 kilo-ohm 1/4 watt resistor to use as a pull-up resistor with the push button.
Servo

Communication between Pi, Arduino and Laptop
- Send and receive packages/strings
Classification problem
- Train the model first
- Must be able to classify images and print to console

Demo:
We want to educate children on how to recycle properly from a young age and inculcate sustainable practices in them.

Our product is a simple game that allows a fun learning experience for kids to learn about recycling categories

1.	// start the program
2.	Choose your trash
3.	Guess what category it belongs to
4.	Classify the image taken by the pi camera through a Tensorflow Convolutional Neural Network model
5.	Show the result

Future improvement:
Classify plastics into their subgroups (recyclable, non-recyclable, needs to be washed)
Put the game system in kindergarten and/or primary schools
Implement reward system
More categories
Faster image classification time

Q&A
Why use CNN?
We read from online sources that say CNN is suitable for image data

How do you train the model?
We used a pre-trained MobileNet model with an extra layer, and we trained the extra layer with our own dataset
We trained it in a docker container on our laptop, and transfer the trained model to the Raspberry Pi
